        <h2>Banana Split</h2>
        <p>Here is the recipe for how to make banana split:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ingredients: 1 lb. strawberries, chopped, 1/4 c. granulated sugar, 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar, 2 Tbsp. water, divided, 1/2 tsp. cornstarch</li>
            <li>Directions: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, toss fruit, granulated sugar, vinegar or lime juice, and 1 tbsp. water. Bring to a simmer and cook, mashing occasionally, until fruit is totally broken down, 8 to 10 minutes. Strain syrup, saving fruit solids for another use, and return syrup to saucepan. In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch and remaining 1 tbsp. water, then whisk into syrup. If making pineapple syrup, stir in cinnamon and cayenne. Return to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until syrup has reached your desired consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool. Make Ahead: Syrup can be made 3 weeks ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, whisk granulated sugar, milk, and salt until sugar is dissolved. Simmer until you begin to see some bubbling along edges of mixture, 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Whisk in cocoa powder until incorporated with no lumps remaining. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate until melted and smooth. Let cool 3 minutes. Add butter a piece at a time, stirring and letting pieces melt before adding more. Set aside until ready to use. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed (or in bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment), in a medium bowl, beat cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla until stiff peaks form. In a small bowl, mash 1 banana with a fork until no chunks remain. Fold into whipped cream, then transfer to a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Slice remaining 4 bananas in half lengthwise and arrange among sundae bowls. Place 3 scoops ice cream between banana slices. Pipe whipped cream over ice cream. Top with fruit syrup, hot fudge, sprinkles, walnuts, and cherries.</li>
